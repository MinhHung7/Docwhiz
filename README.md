# üìÑ DocWhiz ‚Äì AI-Powered PDF Assistant
DocWhiz is an intelligent chatbot powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), designed to help users interact with PDF documents more effectively. Whether you're asking questions, summarizing content, creating custom notes, or visualizing ideas through mindmaps ‚Äî DocWhiz transforms static PDFs into dynamic and personalized learning tools.

## üí° Inspiration
While using Google NotebookLM, I noticed a few key limitations that inspired the creation of DocWhiz:
- **Hallucination Issues**: In some cases, NotebookLM responded with content that wasn‚Äôt in the uploaded document. For example, I uploaded a 30-page excerpt from a Vietnamese grade 5 textbook, but the generated summary omitted those specific pages ‚Äî indicating that the model might have relied too heavily on its training data instead of the actual input file.
- **Lack of Customization**: The generated notes and mindmaps had a rigid structure ‚Äî users couldn‚Äôt edit or personalize them to fit their own thinking or learning style.

These challenges highlighted the need for a more accurate, document-grounded assistant that also offers flexibility in note-taking and visualization. That‚Äôs how DocWhiz was born ‚Äî a tool that:
- Answers your questions only based on the content you upload
- Lets you fully customize notes and mindmaps to match your style
- Supports manual editing if you want to tweak the results

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Project Status
- Note: DocWhiz is currently under active development and not yet deployed online.
You can run it locally for testing and experimentation.
